# Math Solutions Repository

This repository contains solutions to various mathematical problems from different textbooks. The solutions are written in Markdown and typeset using KaTeX for clear and professional formatting.

## Structure

The repository is organized by textbooks. Each textbook has its own folder, and within each textbook folder, there are Markdown files with solutions to the problems in each chapter.

## Usage

- Navigate to the textbook folder you are interested in.
- Open the Markdown files to view the solutions.
- For the best experience, use a Markdown editor that supports KaTeX rendering, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) extension.
