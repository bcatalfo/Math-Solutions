*Exercise 1.1*
(i) Show that \( [v, 0] = 0 = [0, v]\) for all \( v \in L \)
**Solution**
Since the Lie bracket is bilinear, we have
$$
[v, 0] = [v, 0 + 0] = [v, 0] + [v, 0]　
$$
and
$$
[0, v] = [0 + 0, v] = [0, v] + [0, v]　
$$
Subtracting \( [v, 0]\) from the first equation and \( [0, v] \) from the second gives the desired result.
