**2.1.** \(\triangleright\) How many different bijections are there between a set \(S\) with \(n\) elements and itself? \(\S \mathrm{II}2.1\) 
**Solution**
\(n!\) of course :3 As there are \(n\) choices as to where to send the first element, \(n - 1\) choices for the second element, etc. \(\square\)
****
**2.2.** \(\triangleright\) Prove statement (2) in Proposition 2.1. You may assume that given a family of disjoint nonempty subsets of a set, there is a way to choose one element in each member of the family. \([\S 2.5, \mathrm{V}. 3.3]\)
**Solution**
Assume \(A \neq \emptyset\) and let \(f: A \to B\) be a function. Statement (2) in Proposition 2.1 asks us to prove that \(f\) has a right-inverse if and only if it is surjective.
