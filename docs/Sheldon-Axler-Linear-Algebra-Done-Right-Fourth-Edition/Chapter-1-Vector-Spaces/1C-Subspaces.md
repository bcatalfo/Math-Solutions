**1** &nbsp; For each of the following subsets of $\mathbf{F}^3$, determine whether it is a subspace of $\mathbf{F}^3$.
(a) &nbsp; $\{ (x_1,x_2,x_3) \in \mathbf{F}^3: x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0 \}$
(b) &nbsp; $\{ (x_1,x_2,x_3) \in \mathbf{F}^3: x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 4 \}$
(c) &nbsp; $\{ (x_1,x_2,x_3) \in \mathbf{F}^3:  x_1x_2x_3 = 0 \}$
(d) &nbsp; $\{ (x_1,x_2,x_3) \in \mathbf{F}^3: x_1 = 5x_3 \}$

**7** &nbsp; Prove or give a counterexample: If $U$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbf{R}^2$ such that $U$ is closed under addition and under taking additive inverses (meaning $-u \in U$ whenever $u \in U$), then $U$ is not a subspace of $\mathbf{R}^2$.

**9** &nbsp; A function $f: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}$ is called _periodic_ if there exists a positive number $p$ such that $f(x) = f(x+p)$ for all $x \in \mathbf{R}$. Is the set of periodic functions from $\mathbf{R}$ to $\mathbf{R}$ a subspace of $\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{R}}$? Explain.
