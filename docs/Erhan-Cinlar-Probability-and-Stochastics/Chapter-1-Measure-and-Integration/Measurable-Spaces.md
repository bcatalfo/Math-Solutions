1.9 &nbsp; *Partition generated \(\sigma\)-algebras*.
\(\quad \text{a)} \>\) Let \(\mathcal{C} = \{A, B, C\}\) be a partition of \(E\). List the elements of \(\sigma \mathcal{C}\).
\(\quad \text{b)} \>\) Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a (countable) partition of \(E\). Show that every element of \(\sigma \mathcal{C}\) is a countable union of elements taken from \(\mathcal{C}\). Hint: Let \(\mathcal{E}\) be the collection of all sets that are countable unions of elements taken from \(\mathcal{C}\). Show that \(\mathcal{E}\) is a \(\sigma\)-algebra, and argue that \(\mathcal{E} = \sigma \mathcal{C}\).
\(\quad \text{c)} \>\) Let \(E = \R\), the set of all real numbers. Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be the collection of all singleton subsets of \(\R\), that is, each element of \(\mathcal{C}\) is a set that consists of exactly one point in \(\R\). Show that every element of \(\sigma \mathcal{C}\) is either a countable set or the complement of a countable set. Incidentally, \(\sigma \mathcal{C}\) is much smaller than \(\mathcal{B}(\R)\); for instance, the interval \((0, 1)\) belongs to the latter but not to the former.
