**Exercise 2.2**
Verify the each of the following examples is in fact a topology.
(a) Let \( X \) be any set whatsoever, and let \( \mathcal{T} = \mathcal{P}(X)\) (the ***power set of X***, which is the set of all subsets of X), so every subset of X is open. This is called the ***discrete topology on X***, and \( (X, \mathcal{T})\) is called a ***discrete space***.
